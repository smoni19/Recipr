## Our approach
- Initially, we decided our working practises.  This consisted of how we would schedule things such as morning stand-ups, retros, splitting the workload and what to do if anyone had issues
- As a team, we took a couple of days as a group to get a basic understanding of the MERN tech stack
- Once we had all become more comfortable, we felt able to split into groups and get started adding features etc

## MVP
- We decided that our MVP was allowing a user to be able to search MealDB for recipes and have them display on the homepage

## Team Struggles
- Learning a new tech stack
- Understanding how to interact with a JSON object - time we spent stuck on this could have been used to implement more ways to search MealDB
- We didn't manage to host on Heroku as we had ran out of time
- It would have been easier to use Bootstrap from the start

## Team Successes
- Learning a new tech stack
- We managed to successfully split the workload via branching so that code wasn't overwritten
- We kept to our schedule

## What I would like to add/imrpove
- The ability to change the search parameters e.g. search by category (vegetarian/seafood etc), by ingredient, by country etc
- We currently have 3 versions of the mealmodal/mealcard/mealcontainer as we are pulling data from a few places.  We found it was faster to copy and alter the components but I would like to rewrite the base component to be able to take data from those places.
